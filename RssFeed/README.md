Why use RSS?

RSS was designed to show selected data.

Without RSS, users will have to check your site daily for new updates. This may be too time-consuming for many users. With an RSS feed (RSS is often called a News feed or RSS feed) they can check your site faster using an RSS aggregator (a site or program that gathers and sorts out RSS feeds).

Since RSS data is small and fast-loading, it can easily be used with services like cell phones or PDA's.

Web-rings with similar information can easily share data on their web sites to make them better and more useful.
Who Should use RSS?
Webmasters who seldom update their web sites do not need RSS!

RSS is useful for web sites that are updated frequently, like:

News sites - Lists news with title, date and descriptions
Companies - Lists news and new products
Calendars - Lists upcoming events and important days
Site changes - Lists changed pages or new pages
